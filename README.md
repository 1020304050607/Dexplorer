# Dexplorer

Dex is a personal project for an full on terminal based file explorer built in Python. It was ispired by other terminal tools and other competitors Dex scopes to combine practicality with a easy to use TUI GUI.  
Our goal was never to replace dominating file managers but to provide a lightweight and fun experience browsing managing files and cleaning trash inside your terminal.  
Dex unlike many other TUIs focuses on simplicity and accessibility rather bloat and other useless stuff.

## What Dex is not

Dex is not:  
- A non terminal GUI file manager and universal tool for every use case.  

Instead itâ€™s a light optimized terminal tool designed for quick navigation and file ops with the option to make it better via scripts.

## Features

- File exploring: navigate directories with minimal keystrokes.  
- Trash system: move files to trash restore them or wipes everything clean (with warning).  
- Search: quick search files in directory or across the filesystem.  
- Open with external tools:  
  - $EDITOR for text files  
  - mpv for media  
  - xdg-open for everything else  
- File creation: new files, directories, Programming scripts, or shell scripts.  
- Clipping operations: copy cut paste and clear.  
- Sorting: by name size type or modification time.  
- Optional: sudo editing.  
- Minimal terminal design readable in any terminal.  

## Controls

Default navigation is single-key driven:  

- 1 / 2 - Move up/down  
- Enter - Open file or directory  
- 4 - Back  
- h - Help  
- q - Quit  

Additional features, renaming, moving, trashing, restoring, and more (see help menu).

## Modes

- Explorer mode: Default file navigation.  
- Trash mode: Browse and restore or delete trashed files.  
- Search mode: Accurate search with quick preview (unlike other file managers).  
- Sort mode: Easy to use sorting of directory entries.
